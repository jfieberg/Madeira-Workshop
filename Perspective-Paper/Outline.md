# Introduction

1. Motivating questions that marine ecologists would like to be able to answer using tracking data (these should be informed by participant input...I've included a few possibilities below)
    - Characterize behaviors (foraging/traveling/etc)
    - Determine spatial "hot spots" / habitat selection
    - Species interactions, etc...
2. Challenges
    - Large measurement error associated with locations
    - Gaps / variable sampling frequencies
    - Non-representative sampling (some devices only provide locations when marine mammals surface) or limited sampling (availabe only where towers are placed)



# Review of currently available methods

- State-space models
- Hidden Markov Models (discrete and continuous time)
- Resource and step-selection analyses in discrete time
- Continuous time models for home range, habitat selection, movement speed

# Limitations of current methods

- Data hungry / computationally intensive if we want to address all complexities 
- Continuous time models are more appropriate but more difficult to understand and fit to data
- ...


# Promising avenues for future research
