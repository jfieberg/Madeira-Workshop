- **Data**: data for associated exercises
- **Output**: will store reproducible documents created from running R code 
- **Papers**: published papers related to resource and step-selection analyses
- **Presentations**: presentations related to resource and step-selection analyses
- **RCode**: code associated with exercises
    - amt_demo_iSSF.R = demonstration of fitting integrated step-selection analyses using the `amt` package
    - Otters_SSF.R = mixed SSF
    - two_step_approach.R = comparison of mixed effects SSF fit using `glmmTMB` and a two-step approach to model fitting.
    - [potentially to come...] = using the `mixedSSA` package to explore mixed-iSSFs.
